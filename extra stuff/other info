400 dpi, windows mouse @ 6/11, mousefix
logitech g502 (g9 v1 best mouse though)
xtrfy keyboard
hd650 headphones
xonar essence stx soundcard
165hz gsync monitor

other specs irrelevant, as long as your gpu can handle 165 stable fps, if you have less than 165hz monitor i would 
drop fps to 1 above your hz, unless you have below 100hz monitor, in which case i would set fps_max to 101.
